# Traffic-Accidents-Analysis
I analysed road traffic accidents in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and gained some interesting insights. The data was collated from Kaggle and it span from 2016-2020. 

## Hypotheses generated
1. People with less driving experiences are likely to cause accident

2. Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) are common during rainy periods

3. Casualties tend to worsen with the number of vehicles involved.

4. Most accidents occur in residential areas

5. The day and time most accidents occur alluding it to b due to rush hour

## Key Findings:
Gender & Age: Men were predominantly involved in accidents, likely due to a higher number of male drivers. The age group most affected was between 18-30 years old, and many of these drivers had only a junior school education.
Injury Severity: Most injuries were slight, and notably, the majority of those involved had 5-10 years of driving experience.
Timing & Vehicles: Fridays saw the most accidents, with automobiles and public transport being the vehicles most often implicated. Interestingly, while men were the primary victims, the weather conditions during these accidents were usually normal, and most incidents occurred during the day.

## Hypotheses Tested:
The scatter plot revealed a weak relationship between the number of vehicles involved and the number of casualties, suggesting that more vehicles don't necessarily lead to significantly more casualties.
Contrary to my initial hypothesis, most accidents didn't occur during rainy conditions but rather under normal weather conditions.
I also expected that accidents would be more common among less experienced drivers, but it turns out that those with at least 5 years of experience were often at fault.

## Major Insights:
Automobiles (often private cars) were frequently responsible for accidents, likely due to rush hour traffic as people hurried home, leading to a lack of proper spacing between vehicles.
The high incidence of accidents on Fridays suggests a correlation with the end-of-week rush hour.
